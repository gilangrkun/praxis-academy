### Mempraktikan *Collaborative Development with Git*

#### Examples Scenario

Here's our scenario: Alice starts a project called "rhymes", it's a simple Git repo with a bunch of Alice's favorite nursery rhymes stored in it. Bob uses the project and wants to contribute to it. Specifically, he wants to contribute a few new rhymes, and help improve formatting to make the documents easier to read. Alice will review Bob's changes, accept some of them, then make her own changes to the project. Then Bob needs to sync up his copy of the project with Alice's.

Alice's rhymes project is hosted on GitHub, which conveniently provides beautiful graphical interfaces for exploring and interacting with Git repositories. This makes it easy for Bob and other people to use and contribute to.

The steps below walk through both Alice's and Bob's workflows step-by-step. Follow along on your own computer as Alice or Bob. If you have a partner to do this with, one of you can be Alice and one of you can be Bob, or if you have two GitHub accounts, you can play both roles.
